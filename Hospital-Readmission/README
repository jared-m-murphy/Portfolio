Introduction
Patient recidivism in hospitals can present a high expense. If likely readmission could be detected early, 
medical staff can take the necessary measures to prevent a patient from needing to be readmitted to inpatient care. 
While inpatient care can be quite expensive, outpatient care can be quite cheap in comparison. It is in the best 
interest of a hospital to minimize patient early recidivism rate as much as possible so they can stay within budget 
and allocate precious resources most effectively. To do this, a model that can accurately predict if a patient is 
likely to be readmitted in under 30 days would be most helpful. This analysis attempts to create that model based 
on the UCI dataset found here https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130+us+hospitals+for+years+1999+2008
